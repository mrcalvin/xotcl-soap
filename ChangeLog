	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: fix for erroneous
          if-expression in SoapFault->parse which failed on fault
          messages that did not contain all fault-specific elements.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Changed SoapHttpListener to support
          the new naming/addressing scheme as introduced by xorb 0.4.
	  Added a new mixin ::xosoap::Soap::Invoker or rather a new
          method to it, which handles the resolution of the external
          (URL-based) object ids to the internal, canonical object id.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Changed property interface of
          SoapGlueObject slightly: invocationStyle was renamed to
          messageStyle, it now hosts Attributes for storing
          marshalled/unmarshalled requests and responses (formerly
          ContextObject directly). Added higher-level interface
          entities SoapObject and SoapClass.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl: Changed calls to MetaAny to
          MetaPrimitive or MetaComposite as required by xorb 0.4.

	* Pitched version to 0.4 and changed dependencies to xorb 0.4.

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Fixed for a missing namespace
          qualifiers for the package class. Now initiates silently.
