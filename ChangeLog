2008-11-27  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl (arguments): Parsing invocation
	arguments was unaware of the DOM-specific way of extracting
	qualified and unqualified element names. This caused qualified
	element names turning into invocation argument names, obviously
	leading to a dispatching error. Thanks, again, to Michael
	Totschnig for reporting.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl (SoapStruct): Fixed erroreneous WSDL
	generation for nested SOAP structs; previously, namespace prefixes
	(types) were missing in type attributes and the element and type
	name were confused. Thanks to Michael Totschnig for reporting and
	for suggesting a patch.

2008-07-10  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl (arguments): In RPC, SOAP docs
	not being WS-I/BP compliant may include unqualified, local
	elements. This needs to be tackled at the tDOM level accordingly.
	Thanks to Nima Mazloumi for hinting this in an interop case with
	Axis 1.3.

2008-07-09  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* www/admin/run-storm.tcl: Micro-fix for path resolution to test
	suites.

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Verifying the existence of a
	SOAPAction header field was too restrictive. Fixed for
	compliance. Thanks to Nima Mazloumi for providing the initial
	hint.

2008-06-16  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Adjusting HttpTransportProvider to
	the refined/ revised request manager interface as required by
	AsyncHttpRequest in xotcl-core 0.87+.

2008-06-08  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* COPYRIGHT: Fixed copyright dates for 2008

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Generalised support for the timeout
	constraints to be enforced by the transport provider. This takes
	advantage of the newly introduced http-level blocking-timeout
	feature (xotcl-core > 0.86).

	* xotcl-soap.info: Bumped xorb dependency to 0.5d

2008-03-26  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Introduced ::xo::library and articulated first file-level
	dependencies. 

	* Bumped version to 0.5d 

2008-03-11  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* www/badge.xsl: Adjusted xslt style sheet to WS-I modifications,
	in particular retrieving style information centrally from
	soap:binding elements (and not operations).
	
	* tcl/xosoap-wsdl-procs.tcl: Switched from 'ns_conn location' to
	'ad_url', as suggested by Malte Sussdorff. Thanks for noting this,
	Malte!

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Provided for multiple uri-scheme-
	-to-TransportProvider-class resolution. This allows to select between
	http and https by simply changing the uri scheme. In fact, a
	long-standing bug. A more elegant to the overall resolution issue
	comes with the 0.5 feature releases on the protocol plug-in
	infrastructure.

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Fixed for re-casting internal
	exceptions, by default, to a SOAP Fault container. Must have been
	left commented by mistake. Renamed fault container class to
	InternalException rather than UnknownInvocationException.

	* Final maintenance release in 0.4.x genealogy: 0.4.4 

2008-01-16  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Bumped version number of trunk to 0.4.3 

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl (OutboundRequest): Commit minor bugfix
	for document/literal mode, removing unneeded element prefix.

2007-12-30  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* www/demo/demo-prolix-qpr-consumer.tcl: Added a demo consumer,
	showing how to create a simplistic Rpc/Encoded consumer.

2007-12-13  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: Introduced a necessary and
	temporary fix for parsing SOAP faults by means of
	non-namespace-aware DOM. We soon have to switch to a more robust
	parsing technique.

2007-11-14  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: FIX - Added the missing __informationType
	info to SoapClass.

	* www/admin/storm/SOAPBuildersRound2BaseConsumer.suite: Added the
	SOAPBuilders Interoperability Lab "Round 2" Base suite as storm
	test suite. It incrementally builds up a consumer and tests
	against the corresponding provider that is initialised by default. 

2007-11-13  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* www/admin/storm/HttpEndpoint.suite: Added a first basic test
	suite for the xorb http listener.

	* www/admin/run-storm.tcl: Adding some generic test-running
	environment that will be steadily extended. It can be used to
	arbitrarily select storm test suites to be sourced and executed.

2007-11-07  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Finalised first implementation step for a generic context
          information support (SOAP 1.1/1.2 Headers) for xosoap, based
          on xorb's invocation contexts, both for the provider and
          consumer side.
	  - Integration (and specialising) with the xorb context interface
          (setContext/getContext), providing for a dynamic namespace
          bindings. This is required because SOAP 1.1/1.2 require
          so-called SOAP header blocks to be fully qualified.
	  - Context mangling is now possible at various hook levels
          (protocol plug-in mixins, interceptors, beyond ...),
          the streaming of context information is postponed to the
          latest possible point in time (just before the marshaling
          steps).
	  - Some refinements of the SOAP Object representation
          infrastructure. Making use of the chain of responsibility to
          dynamically resolve namespace scopes, document-wide
          assignment of auto-generated prefices etc.
	  - The visitor responsible for context-related tasks
          (ContextDataVisitor) has been rewritten and generalised.

2007-10-25  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Allow substifying of invocation
          context properties in callnamespace property.

2007-10-24  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: In line with xorb r113, we
          fixed a general issue with the overall flow of request
          handler and interceptors. We enforced a "passification"
          along the basic steps, as invocation data setting,
          marshaling, dispatch, delivery, to ensure that interceptors
          can influence the state of the unmarshalledRequest and have
          it rendered or even inject their own marshaller etc.

2007-10-23  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Re-write of
          HttpTransportProvider to support core's improved http client
          facilities (e.g. statusCode -> status_code) and non-blocking
          transport (as one part of the asynchrony support in xorb et
          al. 0.4.2+).

	* Pitched to version 0.4.2; requires xorb in version 0.4.2 to
          support the new features. Provided for xotcl-core 0.74
          compat (::xosoap::Package etc.)

2007-10-08  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: Minor amendment; anythings
          are now nested into the soap element composite (to allow for
          simple persistence through nested serialisation).

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Fixed a buggy behaviour in the
          interceptors' response flow: Till now, the protocol client
          mixin class send the extracted response value (Anything)
          through the response flow while interceptors need/expected
          the unmarshaled soap response structure.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Sample authentication interceptor,
          re-usable interceptor type SoapInterceptor.

	* tcl/10-xosoap-exceptions-procs.tcl: Fixed another crappy
          exception handling bit: InvocationScenarioException should not
          necessarily be a fault type.

2007-10-03  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Fixed a bug with errorneous
          Exception reference (MarshallingException =>
          Server::MarshallingException).

2007-09-21  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl (DocumentLiteral::InboundRequest):
          Fixed a presumably old bug back from 1.5.4beta times when
          switches where defect and I changed all switches ("Anything
          add -parse" etc.) to ordinary nonpos args.

	* tcl/xosoap-wsdl-procs.tcl: Fixed a typo, with
          DocumentLiteral being rendered as rpc in a concrete wsdl.

2007-09-20  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Introduced a general mean of
          adding http header information to glue objects and have it
          unfolded into the actual request. This was needed to allow
          for adding HTTP Auth information, for instance.

2007-09-19  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl (InboundRequest): Fixed a nasty typo
          in RpcEncoded style.

	* Added a new package param: "authentication_support" 

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Added a
          SoapAuthenticationInterceptor that is automatically
          registered with the default interceptor chain ::xorb::coi
          and requires a new package param ("authentication_support")  
	  to be set to 1 to be active. The interceptor allows for  1-)
          HTTP basic authentication (see RFC 2617 at
          http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) 2-) SOAP Header (header
          fields: 'username' + 'password'). Cookie support might come in but
          it is not quite clear how usage scenarios are meant to be
          for cookies. Shifted identifier resolution to an earlier
          stage, to have the resolved ("internal") identifier
          available to interceptors.

2007-09-18  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Pitched trunk to 0.4.1 

2007-09-14  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/10-xosoap-exceptions-procs.tcl: Partial rewrite of
          exception handling: Exception information is now streamed
          into an xml structure which is more versatile to be used and
          rendered in various surroundings.

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: Fixed SOAP Header parsing
          and made the parser sensible whether soap header blocks are
          present or not. Thanks to Michael Totschning for reporting
          and even providing an initial patch, the final solution is a
          bit more generic than this patch proposed.

2007-09-13  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl (OutboundRequest): Added SOAP header
          support to invocation data visitor styles. Remains to be
          completed, but is operative. 

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Fixed a bug with errorenous
          clientPlugin settings for soap glue types. Was changed from
          ::xosoap::client::Soap::Client to
          ::xosoap::Soap::Client. Some adjustments for SOAP header support.

	* tcl/xosoap-visitor-procs.tcl: Enabling SOAP header support
          by adding a ContextDataVisitor that re-packs context info
          into context object upon de-marshaling. Adapted
          SoapMarshallerVisitor for header marshaling support.

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: Introduced support for
          SOAP header blocks by adding SoapHeader and
          SoapHeaderField. Parsing logic included.

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Fixed a minor bug in
          generating the external object identifier (uri segment) in
          the special case of qualified, top-level (::*) named
          contracts/ implementations, and unqualified, old-style OACS
          named contracts/ implementations (without any namespace
          delimiters). Thanks to Michael Totschnig for reporting.

2007-09-10  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl (OutboundResponse/OutboundRequest):
          Following, somewhat, the WS-I BP 1.1 requirement 1005+, we
          do not marshal a default encodingStyle attribute (and
          SOAP-ENC namespace declaration) anymore but in the
          ::xosoap::RcpEncoded mode. 

2007-09-09  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-wsdl-procs.tcl (Wsdl1.1Builder): Continued
          improvement of WS-I compat:
	  - Introduced a package parameter 'wsi_bp_compliant' for
          discriminating a WSDL 1.1 and WS-I BP 1.0/1.1 compat mode
          and leave the decision to the developer.
	  - WS-I BP 1.0/1.1 R2705: Does not allow for mixed styled
          bindings; compliance requires: 
	  a-) to have a style attribute for the entire soap:binding
          scope 
	  b-) no per-operation style settings that would overrule
          accordins to WSDL 1.1
	  - WS-I BP 1.0/1.1 R2717: We need to make sure, that within
          soap:operation blocks, we explicitly set the namespace
          attribute to elements such as soap:body if we use the
          literal style.

2007-09-07  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-wsdl-procs.tcl: WSDL generation, improved WS-I
          Basic Profile 1.1 compat.
	  - Values of name attributes (e.g. wsdl:definitions name):
          According to WSDL 1.1, NMTokens (i.e. allowing for qualified
          Tcl names with ":") are sufficient, according to BP
          1.1. (#2703), however, we need NCNames which do not allow
          for ":". We, therefore, switch to the canonical, underscored
          notation of contract names.  

2007-09-06  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Tagged 0.4 preview release

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Fixed a typo in the
          before-uninstall callback and cleaned for unused once!
          SOAP-specific anythings are not 
          removed during installation of the protocol plug-in, but of
          xorb. this does not break the contracts/ impls and shifts
          responsibility to the type sponsorships.
	  

2007-09-05  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/zz-demo/manual-init.tcl: Added this little helper to
          load provider examples that comes with xorb's
          manual. Currently just one, but this will be extended.

2007-08-30  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Changed request handling and
          package init logic to more differntiate better between post
          vs. get, invocations in either case or simple ui
          requests. Some former http-level exceptions became proper
          soap faults. 

	* Renamed the package parameter.

2007-08-27  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: We now take care of rendering
          solid relative hrefs for the service badges. This avoids
          confusion when there is no trailing slash provided.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Applied some cosmetics to exception
          catching, to avoid unwanted verbosity in the logs. 

2007-08-26  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: Support for streaming xml
          per-element 'default' namespaces (unprefixed, element-scoped
          namespaces).

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Added a return handler for
          exception pages (returnException). In general, we know use
          openacs default masters for badge and exception pages.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Exceptions are know rendered through
          a package-aware renderer (returnException).
	  Fixed RpcEncoded marshaling style: Specific namespaces (xsi,
          xsd) are only rendered in this mode.
	  Added support for two modes of marshaling the call
          namespace: either as per-element, prefixed or per-element,
          default namespace. Simply provide a single- (default) or
          two-element (prefixed) list to the callNamespace attribute.

2007-08-08  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Made all-service badge aware
          of the binding state. Deployed therefore means registered
          with the invoker.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Added a new exception type (at
          the level of http transport provider) to capture failures on
          connection handling. Is basically thrown if no response data
          is received at (regardless of http state codes).

2007-08-06  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* Added three new wui files, needed for the aforementioned
          badges: badge.adp, xosoap-master.adp, badge.xsl. The xsl
          stylesheet is a nifty one, as it produces the per-service
          badges out of the wsdl description. Needs to be further
          extended, but it is a start.

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: The upgrade of
          ::xosoap::Package is the main change/achievement in this
          revision. The package is now created for each invocation and
	  simple http interaction, it serves as basic dispatcher
          (solicit=* methods). It provides some basic wui managing
          support, that will constantly increase. We provide two first
          wui features, so called 'badges'. One, the all-service
          badge, lists all available/deployed services (see
          /xosoap/services/), the other per-service information
          (service badge, see
          e.g. /xosoap/service/xosoap/demo/SoapInterop2Impl?s=badge).
	  Major changes are: The dispatcher can easily allow for
          get-base invocations (in the future), to get wsdl files for
          a service, one has to provide the parameter pair s=wsdl (and
          not ?wsdl as in previous revisions).

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Major rewrite due to separation
	of connection and invocation context. We, now, use proper
	'brand new' soap envelope objects for responses, and do not
	re-use request objects for this purpose. this yields a proper
	use by interceptors and no error-prone visitor traversal (due
	to the specifics of composites as realised by
	OrderedComposite). Major dispatching responsibiliy has be
	shifted to ::xosoap::Package.

2007-08-02  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* www/demo/demo-interop2-base-client.tcl: Tested and fixed for
          new features/internals.

	* tcl/zz-demo/interop2-base-server-init.tcl: Moved to new,
          short-cut notation for Abstract/Delegate/Method. Fixed some
          typos and tested again.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl: Introduced new meta class for
          xs/soap specific anythings: SoapPrimitive and SoapComposite

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Ported over to support
	xotcl-core's package facilities, the new state handler
	are called onMount and onUnmount. 

	* tcl/xosoap-init.tcl: Minor rewrite, migrated to
          xotcl-core-based package infrastructure.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Added inline documentation for
          SoapGlueObject, SoapObject and SoapClass.

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Partial rewrite, following
          the migration to xotcl-core's package facilities. This
          follows recent revisions of xorb. Also added an
          before-uninstall trace that will clear xsd types realised as
          acs message types.

2007-07-10  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: fix for erroneous
          if-expression in SoapFault->parse which failed on fault
          messages that did not contain all fault-specific elements.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Changed SoapHttpListener to support
          the new naming/addressing scheme as introduced by xorb 0.4.
	  Added a new mixin ::xosoap::Soap::Invoker or rather a new
          method to it, which handles the resolution of the external
          (URL-based) object ids to the internal, canonical object id.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Changed property interface of
          SoapGlueObject slightly: invocationStyle was renamed to
          messageStyle, it now hosts Attributes for storing
          marshalled/unmarshalled requests and responses (formerly
          ContextObject directly). Added higher-level interface
          entities SoapObject and SoapClass.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl: Changed calls to MetaAny to
          MetaPrimitive or MetaComposite as required by xorb 0.4.

	* Pitched version to 0.4 and changed dependencies to xorb 0.4. 

2007-06-28  Stefan Sobernig  <stefan.sobernig@wu-wien.ac.at>

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Fixed for a missing namespace
          qualifiers for the package class. Now initiates silently.
