	* www/demo/demo-interop2-base-client.tcl: Tested and fixed for
          new features/internals.

	* tcl/zz-demo/interop2-base-server-init.tcl: Moved to new,
          short-cut notation for Abstract/Delegate/Method. Fixed some
          typos and tested again.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl: Introduced new meta class for
          xs/soap specific anythings: SoapPrimitive and SoapComposite

	* tcl/xosoap-package-procs.tcl: Ported over to support
	xotcl-core's package facilities, the new state handler
	are called onMount and onUnmount. 

	* tcl/xosoap-init.tcl: Minor rewrite, migrated to
          xotcl-core-based package infrastructure.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Added inline documentation for
          SoapGlueObject, SoapObject and SoapClass.

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Partial rewrite, following
          the migration to xotcl-core's package facilities. This
          follows recent revisions of xorb. Also added an
          before-uninstall trace that will clear xsd types realised as
          acs message types.

	* tcl/xosoap-marshaller-procs.tcl: fix for erroneous
          if-expression in SoapFault->parse which failed on fault
          messages that did not contain all fault-specific elements.

	* tcl/15-xosoap-procs.tcl: Changed SoapHttpListener to support
          the new naming/addressing scheme as introduced by xorb 0.4.
	  Added a new mixin ::xosoap::Soap::Invoker or rather a new
          method to it, which handles the resolution of the external
          (URL-based) object ids to the internal, canonical object id.

	* tcl/xosoap-client-procs.tcl: Changed property interface of
          SoapGlueObject slightly: invocationStyle was renamed to
          messageStyle, it now hosts Attributes for storing
          marshalled/unmarshalled requests and responses (formerly
          ContextObject directly). Added higher-level interface
          entities SoapObject and SoapClass.

	* tcl/xosoap-xsd-procs.tcl: Changed calls to MetaAny to
          MetaPrimitive or MetaComposite as required by xorb 0.4.

	* Pitched version to 0.4 and changed dependencies to xorb 0.4.

	* tcl/xosoap-callback-procs.tcl: Fixed for a missing namespace
          qualifiers for the package class. Now initiates silently.
